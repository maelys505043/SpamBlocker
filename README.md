# Target Audience
- :white_check_mark: For people who tends to avoid unknown calls.
- For those who need to answer unknown calls, for example, salespeople or lawyers, etc:
  - :white_check_mark: If your carrier supports STIR/SHAKEN attestation, or there is any public spam database available for your country.
  - :x: Otherwise, consider using a blocker with its own spam database.

# How it works
It works without replacing your default call/SMS app.
 - For call: <br>
 &ensp; It's the Caller ID app 
 - For SMS: <br>
 &ensp; It takes over the SMS notifications, it only filters the notifications, the spam messages will still be present in the SMS app.
   > ðŸ’¡ Please turn off the notification permission of the default SMS app in system settings, otherwise there will be double SMS notifications.

| In Meeting    | Decline calls during online video meetings |
| Off Time      | A time period that always permits calls, usually no spams at night. |
| Spam Database | If it matches any spam number in the database. Any public downloadable spam databases can be integrated, such as the [DNC](https://www.ftc.gov/policy-notices/open-government/data-sets/do-not-call-data).  |
| Regex Pattern | Some typical patterns:<br> - Any number: `.*` (the regex `.*` is equivalent to the wildcard `*` in other apps) <br> - Exact number: `12345` <br> - Starts with 400: `400.*` <br> - Ends with 123: `.*123` <br> - Shorter than 5: `.{0,4}` <br> - Longer than 10: `.{11,}` <br> - Unknown number (it's empty string): `.{0}` or `^$`<br>  - Contains "verification": `.*verification.*` <br> - Contains any of the words: `.*(police\|hospital\|verification).*` <br> - Starts with 400, with leading country code 11 or not: `(?:11)?400.*` <br>- Extract verification code from SMS message: `code.*?(\d+)`<br><br> Ask AI to generate or explain a regex: <br>&emsp; "Show me regex for checking if a string starts with 400 or 200"<br> &emsp; Results in `(400\|200).*` |
